FOSSmanic is an Unmanic-based simple tool for optimising your file library without imposed limitations. You can use it to convert your files into a single, uniform format, manage file movements based on timestamps, or execute custom commands against a file based on its file size.

Simply configure FOSSmanic pointing it at your library and let it automatically manage that library for you.

FOSSmanic provides you with all the Unmanic functionality without any limitation.
